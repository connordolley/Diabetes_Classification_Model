# Diabetes_Classification_Model

A basic binary classifier that predicts the likelihood of an individual getting diabetes based on a set of health metrics compiled into this dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshaydattatraykhare/diabetes-dataset).
These health metrics include Pregnancy, Glucose, BP, Skinthickness, Insulin, BMI, Predigree Function, and Age. This should not be used for any real medical prediction/diagnosis. 

Here is the model accuracy during training:
